Welcome to my _new blog_ about music! I spent a lot more time working on the technical side of this one, so I hope it beats your expectations!

# Introduction
I collect 25 albums here, and this year I decided I would write a little blurb about all of them. Shoegaze, one of my favorite genres, had a really strong year in 2023 and I found a lot of material I liked, without even looking that hard. This year was also the first I spent a lot of time deliberately cataloging the music I listened to. By December 31st, I had clocked over 400 albums in total. I am hoping to go even higher next year! 

Check out this years list of songs, too: <TeenyButton link_text="Songs list" astro_link="/posts/post-2023-songs"/>

    .map((albo) => <AlbumCard place={albo.Place} artist={albo.Artist} album={albo.Album} image={albo.Image} writeup={albo.Writeup}/>)
  }

# Conclusion
Another great year in the books! Hope you liked what I had to say. This page, like me, will live forever so don't worry about bookmarking it.

Don't forget to check out this years [songs list](/posts/post-2023-songs). 50 hot songs without an annoying radio DJ to count them down. Disclaimer: I used to be an annoying radio DJ. There's a playlist to favorite at the bottom too!
